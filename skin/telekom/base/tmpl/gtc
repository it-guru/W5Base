     Common policy (GTCs) for the usage of the W5Base/Darwin database system
===============================================================================
 
  
  §1  blocking of identifications/ contacts
      -------------------------------------
      The administration of W5Base/Darwin is authorized, in cases of careless 
      behaviour of users or by violation against the common policy to ban the 
      identifications. That means especially the efforts to affect the 
      stability system in a negative way or flooding the database with 
      senseless information.

     
  §2  handling with the system
      ------------------------
      The W5Base/Darwin database system has to be used by the users only in 
      the designated way. The user is committed to take care of its access 
      data, they have to be reachable only for his personal usage. 
      Service identifications are only allowed to be used for designated 
      application interfaces. The usage of service identifier for regular, 
      none interface functionality is NOT allowed.

     
  §3  responsibility for data elements
      --------------------------------
      If a user creates data sets in the W5Base/Darwin database system, 
      which are under the assignment to a person in charge for data, so the 
      user is responsible for the data for an unlimited period of time. The 
      handover of data to other users (successors) is only in the authority 
      of the person in charge for data.

     
  §4  data contents
      -------------
      Every User has the full responsibility for his created/modified data. 
      The saving of illegal, pornographic or racist contents is strictly 
      prohibited.


  §5  export/ extraction of data
      --------------------------
      In the W5Base/Darwin Data bank system there are fort he user several 
      methods to export data. The usage of this function should be limited 
      to the minimum for the official business. Forwarding of extracted data 
      without the permission of W5Base/Darwin administrators is strictly 
      prohibited. Permission is only granted by using an "Admin-Request".     
 

  §6  adjustment of rights
      --------------------
      Adjustment of rights, changes to groups, the assignment of contacts to 
      certain groups, requests for data rectifications or general questions 
      to W5Base/Darwin/ Darwin have to be formulated generally as 
      "Admin-Requests". This can be found at "MyW5Base" - "start new Workflow".  
     
  §7  adjustment of central data elements
      -----------------------------------
      The adjustment of central data elements e.g. location data, group 
      labels, mandates or the like, must be documented reasonably and 
      clearly. Demands for this will be processed only as "Admin-Request".

     
  §8  program adjustments and failure corrections in the W5Base/Darwin system
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Program technical adjustments, error messages, expansion requests or 
      ideas for new functions can be submitted with the workflow 
      "ITIL request to the application development". 
      (application: W5Base/Darwin). For a continuous improvement process EVERY 
      user should report recognised bugs in the Web-Surface over the 
      mentioned workflow.
